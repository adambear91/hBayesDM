\note{
\strong{Notes:}
Note that this implementation is NOT the full Drift Diffusion Model as described in Ratcliff (1978). This implementation estimates the drift rate, boundary separation, starting point, and non-decision time; but not the between- and within-trial variances in these parameters.
Code for this model is based on codes/comments by Guido Biele, Joseph Burling, Andrew Ellis, and potential others @ Stan mailing.
